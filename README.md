# periodic-orbit-interface2D

This application uses TKinter python module to create an interface. On this interface, the user can place focal points in a 2D space and observe the resulting limit cycle, should there be one. The app models only the behaviour expected in the case of a 2D piecewise affine system. The system should present only two threshold values for domain definitions, one for each component. This then divides the 2D space in 4 different domains. They will be named as follow : $1$ (top-right), $2$ (top-left), $3$ (bottom-left) and $4$ (bottom-right). The trajectory will alternate domains in the following order : $1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 4 \to 1$. Two versions of the application are available, one with equal degradation rates called Visualisation_app_straight and the other with degradation rates depending on the component and the domain called Visualisation_app_non_straight.
